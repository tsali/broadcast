This is a simple script that will allow you to quickly enter info to test broadcasting with PIFMRDS

ASSUMPTIONS:
1. You already have pifmrds installed and available as a global command
2. You are using a shielded directly connected cable between your transmitter and receiver to ensure no illegal transmissions on public airwaves

To install
1. Log into the bash capable server you're installing it in
2. git clone https://github.com/tsali/broadcast
3. cd into the broadcast directory
4. chmod +x broadcast
5. use from within the broadcast directory (IE ./broadcast or bash broadcast,) or copy to /bin or /usr/bin as necessary

For the copy/paste inclined:                                                                                      

```
git clone https://github.com/tsali/broadcast.git && cd broadcast && chmod +x broadcast
```
